For this assignment you're going to have
to do two
things to successfully submit the
assignment for the course.
First you're going to have to do a little
bit of data analysis.
Fairly straightforward one I think.
And you're going to have to write up your,
a report using R markdown and knitter.
So in order to submit your assignment you
need to first, check
it into a GitHub repository for and then
push your repository to GitHub.
Then you need to submit the link to your
GitHub repository.
That's the first part.
And then the second part is you need to
submit the SHA-1 hash that indicates
the specific commit that corresponds to
the state
of your repository, that, that identifies
your submission.
That way I know kind of, which version of
the files in your repository to look at.
Remember in a Git repository, things can
change
and you track the changes over various
commits.
And so I just need to know which commit
corresponds
to the, your official submission for this
assignment.
So I thought I'd just talk a little bit
about
how to do that, just in case it's not
immediately obvious.
So here I am, I'm looking at my GitHub
repository that I have under my account.
This project's called filehash.
It's actually a R package.
And you can see here's the latest
information
and there's two things that you need to
know.
First is the URL for the repository.
So the URL for the repository for this
project is just up here at the top here.
So it's github.com/rdpeng/filehash.
So that's
the top level URL for this repository and
that's
what you're going to need to submit for
this assignment
as the first part or of course not for
this repository but for the repository
corresponding to your assignment.

The second part you're going to have to
commit, sorry, you have
to submit, is the SHA-1 hash, and so to
figure out what
that is, you can, you can, go to this part
over
here, you can see here I've got 255
commits to this repository.
You will probably have less.
So you'll indicate the number of commits
that you have.
So you can click on that and you can see
it
will list all the commits that you have
going back through time.
The most recent one is at the very top you
can see it's February
10, 2014.
And you can see on the very right over
here.
There is a little abbreviated version.
Of the SHA-1 hash that, that corresponds
to this commit.
So, if the, if the SHA-1 hash that you
want to
submit is just the very latest version of
your repository.
You can just hover over this.
You can see those little copy to clipboard
symbols.
You can just cop, click on that.
And then paste it into the Coursera web
form.
And add
where it asks you to submit the URL in the
SHA-1.
And that's pretty much all you have to do.
If you, if it don't want to submit the
most recent version of the repository.
You say you want to scroll down a little
bit and go to a more an earlier version.
Maybe from say March 12th, 2012.
You can just scroll down to that commit
and then copy the hash for that particular
commit and then paste it in.
Okay?
Now, on the other side of the story, if
you're going to be looking at
someone's GitHub repository, you can first
go
to the URL, for that person's repository.
So, I'm going to go back to the top and
you'll be looking at, the top level, kind
of repository.
And this will show kind of the latest
versions of all the files.
But then you're going to take, you're
going to go to
the, again, you're going to go to the
commit list.
I think you're going to take the hash that
the, that the person gave to you.
And you're going to scroll, you have to
scroll down this
list to see where you can, where the hash
will match.
And if it's the most recent one you'll see
it'll match the top of the order right
here.
And if it's not you'll have to scroll down
a little bit, scroll down a little bit.
But once you find that and commit.
Let's just say the most recent one.
You can go to browse code.
And this will show you the state of
repository.
At that commit.
Alright, so it's kind of a snapshot of the
project at that particular time.
And it's in all these files corresponds
to what the file looked like at that
particular snapshot.
If you are to go back in time a little bit
I could
see what you know what the repository
looked like on March 12th, 2012.
I could go to Browse Code right here.
And then this is what the repository
looked like on March 12.
And so when the, when, when you see a
commit and a
given repo, URL for a repository go to the
top level repository
click on commits, and then find the, the
SHA-1 hash
that corresponds to the commit and then
click on browse code.
So that's how you'll be able to find the
particular snapshot for.
A given project.
So that's pretty much it for submitting a
GitHub repository URL and SHA-1 hash.
So for this assignment you're going to
have to do first you're going to have to
submit those things for your version and
then for the peer assessment you'll have
to evaluate another person's repository by
going to the URL they point to.
And then finding the commit that
corresponds to a given snapshot.
And so that's how you do that in GitHub.
It's fairly straightforward, but I just
wanted to make sure I, you know,
I showed it to you in case you were not
familiar with it.
