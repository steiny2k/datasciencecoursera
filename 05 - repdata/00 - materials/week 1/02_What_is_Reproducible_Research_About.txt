Hi everybody.
Welcome to reproducible research.
The purpose of this lecture is
to introduce you to the idea of
reproducibility, and to kind of explain
why I think it's really important.
Even if you don't think of yourself as
a researcher or as conducting research.
If you analyze data at all, it's
critically important that you understand
the ideas of reproducibility and
the problems that it introduces.
So I want to get that across to
everybody right off the bat, so
you can kind of understand it and
see why it's so important.
Now, in case you're not
familiar with the idea already,
I thought I'd introduce some of the issues
that are raised by reproducibility
by drawing an analogy from another area.
And that's music.
So, before we go on any further just take
a quick listen to this excerpt that I'll
play for you.
[MUSIC]
Okay.
So that was a song called Code Monkey.
It was written, and performed by Jonathan
Colton, and I just played you the first
minute or so of the song that got you
through the first verse and the chorus.
And so, you might want to just rewind and
kind of maybe listen to that excerpt one
more time just to kind of
get it in your head.
You may, it may get stuck in your head,
so I apologize in advance.
In advance but, but
think about that song, and
what you already know about it all right?
So, you know kind of what it sounds like?
You have a sense of,
of who wrote it, who performed it?
You know that it starts with
a guitar in the beginning.
If you have a pretty good ear
you know that it's in F Major.
And, and
then later on another guitar joins as
a drum, a drum kit that plays along.
And of course the, you know, he's
singing along, he's singing the words.
And if you can listen carefully and
you understand the language,
you can even tell what words he's saying.
And so, and
that's pretty much the whole song.
And of course, I didn't play the whole
thing for you, but if I had,
you could of decoded a lot of this
information just from the recording.
Okay?
So, most popular songs like
this are not very complicated.
They don't have.
A lot of instruments,
or a lot of voices, and
they typically range you know
from two to four minutes.
So if, and, if you're a good musician and
you can listen very carefully it's very
actually, it's not that hard to kind of
play the song, maybe on your own guitar or
whatever, after you've heard it.
Okay, now, okay.
Now, let's take a listen
to this piece now.
[MUSIC]
Okay so, incase you didn't recognize it,
that was the very beginning of the
symphony number eight by Gustav Mahler.
It was performed by the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra under the baton of,
Sir George Solti.
And so this might be the polar
opposite of the code monkey song
that I just played for you.
This symphony is sometimes called
the symphony of 1,000, because of just of
the sheer number of people, that have
to be on stage to perform this piece.
You need an entire symphony orchestra.
You need an entire full chorus, to sing.
And, and so
there's a lot of complex moving parts,
needed to perform this piece.
And yet, it get, it gets performed
all this time and, and it's, and
everyone kind of recognizes the piece
when they hear it, because it's more or
less the same thing.
Now, how does that happen, right?
So how is it that orchestras and
choruses all over the world can play
this enormously complex piece, and
it always seems to come off more or
less as the same thing, okay?
So, and similarly, how is it that you
can listen to Jonathan Coulton's song.
And you can hear the music and then
somehow if you're, if you're a, you know,
trained musician, you can pick it up and
maybe play it for yourself.
Okay.
So this is where, this is really
about reproducibility, right.
So in music one of the nice things about,
music in general is that when,
when you hear the performance, regardless
of whether it's a simple popular song or
an enormous symphony.
You get all the information that you need.
And now, depending on the complexity
of the music, you may more or
less information, because the brain
is only able to process so
much information at a time.
But for something that's very complicated,
like a symphony,
we actually have a way to
write down the instructions,
to give to the performers to tell
them how to play each thing.
And so actually,
Mahler is a great example of this,
because he himself was a conductor.
And he knew that as a conductor,
it's often difficult to look
at a composer's music and
understand what is it that, exactly that,
you know, the composer wanted here?
And so when he wrote his music,
he put instructions in every single
inch of that piece of music.
Because that way the conductor
who is interpreting, and
the performers who are interpreting
the music, understand.
Oh, that's what the composer wanted here,
right.
So in, you know, for the symphony.
For the Maller's symphony number eight,
what we have is the score.
So the score is basically a book
that lists every single part
of every instrument, and what they need
to play and what instructions they have.
And so the conductor can look at
the score and say okay, I know what
the violin's playing at this time, and
I know what the flute is playing and
I know what the chorus
is singing at this time.
And that way the music can be coordinated
and all performed and, and, and
kind of synchronized, right.
You can have a score for
a, a, a popular song, too.
So that Code Monkey could have a score,
there's you know, there'd be guitar lines,
there'd be drum lines.
It's typically not written in the same
way that you would write a symphony, but
there's als, but there is a notation
that is used sometimes to communicate
how a piece of music should be performed.
And so, what we're talking about in
this course, Reproducible Research, is,
is basically, you know, how do you
develop the score for a data analysis, so
that you can communicate to
someone what was done, and
if they want to reproduce the work,
how go do it.
Now, the fundamental problem in data
analysis, is that we don't really have
an agreed upon notation system for
communicating data analysis.
And so, everyone kind of does it
a different way, and it's, and,
in aggregate, it's kind of a, a mess.
So some people will just
describe in words what was done.
And in some cases this is sufficient.
This is sufficient but
in many cases it's not.
Some people will provide the computer code
and the data and everything you need.
And sometimes that's good, but
sometimes it's enormously complex and
difficult to sort through.
And so there are a variety of ways that
you can communicate data analysis, but
we just haven't agreed upon what
is a way that we can all, that we,
that is sufficient for everybody, or
more or less sufficient for everybody.
So what we're going to focus
on in this course is, how
to communicate a data analysis using code
by writing documents that are dynamic.
And by sharing data so that other people
can reproduce the work that you're doing.
So this is important for
all data analysis.
It's not just about doing research persay.
And because if you want to communicate
what you've done to other people,
you need to be able to give them
the materials so that they can perform, so
to speak, the analysis themselves.
