Hi everyone, this week's peer assessment
asked you to do a
data analysis based on the National
Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's storm
event database.
So to just give you a little sense of kind
of what I'm
thinking about and what I'm expecting,
I've written up a sample data analysis.
And put a link to it next to this lecture.
So you can go to this link or check out
the link on the website that's associated
with this lecture.
So, good luck on the assessment this week.
I'm looking forward to seeing what you
guys can do.
