# Q1: Suppose I conduct a study and publish my findings. Which of the following 
#     is an example of a replication of my study?

# A1: An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing the 
#     same question, collects her own data, analyzes it separately from me, and 
#     publishes her own findings.

# Q2: Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to 
#     be reproducible?

# A2: The investigator makes the analytic data publicly available.

# Q3: Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?

# A3: The study's analytic data and computer code for the data analysis are 
#     publicly available. When the code is run on the analytic data, the 
#     findings are identical to the published results.

# Q4: Which of the following is a reason that a study might NOT be fully 
#     replicated?

# A4: The original study was opportunistic in its timing and it would be 
#     difficult to find a similar context in which to repeat it.

# Q5: Which of the following is a reason why publishing reproducible research is
#     increasingly important?

# A5: New technologies are increasing the rate of data collection, creating 
#     datasets that are more complex and extremely high dimensional.

# Q6: What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?

# A6: It transforms the measured data into analytic data.

# Q7: Which is a goal of literate statistical programming?

# A7: Combine explanatory text and data analysis code in a single document.

# Q8: What does it mean to weave a literate statistical program?

# A8: Transform the literate program into a human readable document.

# Q9: Which of the following is required to implement a literate programming 
#     system?

# A9: A programming language like R.

# Q10: What is one way in which the knitr system differs from Sweave?

# A10: knitr allows for the use of markdown instead of LaTeX.
