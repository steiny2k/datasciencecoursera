This lecture is about raw and processed
data.
So I'm going to be talking a little bit
about how
raw data might be different, depending on
who you're talking to.
So some people might consider one version
of the data raw,
and some people might consider another
version of the data raw.
So, first, I was going to talk about the
definition of data.
So, as we saw on the data scientist
toolbox, data are
values of qualitative or quantitative
variables, belonging to a set of items.
So the set of items might be the
population, or
the set of objects that you might be
interested in.
And the values, of course, quantitative
variables, and
the variables are the things that you're
measuring.
And you might measure them in qualitative
terms or in quantitative terms.
So, usually when we think about variables,
we think about things like this.
If you look down here at the bottom, we
think about country
of origin, sex, treatment, and
quantitative
variables like height, weight, blood
pressure.
A lot of these measurements are
actually derived from much lower level
measurements.
So, for example, if you think about blood
pressure.
Blood pressure's actually measured by
calculating
a pressure measurement, and so, there's
actually
a lot of low level things that go into
calculating that pressure measurement.
And so, those low level things are the
kinds of things
that we're going to be talking about in
raw versus processed data.
So, the raw data are the original source
of data.
They're often very hard to use for data
analysis, because they're
complicated or they're hard to parse, or
they're very hard to analyze.
Data analysis actually includes the
processing or the cleaning of the data.
If you go and obtain a data set that's
actually a raw
image file and you process it and turn it
into a nice
data frame that then you use to analyze an
r, that data
processing actually is part of the data
analysis, or data science pipeline.
In fact, a huge component of a data
scientist's job is performing those sorts
of processing operations.
The raw data may only need to be processed
once, but
regardless of how often you process it,
you need to keep
a record of all the different things that
you did because
it can have a major impact on the down
steam analysis.
The process data is data that is ready for
analysis.
So, the processing data of the
data might include merging, subsetting,
transforming, or
you might go into a file and extract out
part of a image.
You might go into a file and extract a
little bit of text from
a free form text field, or you may do a
number of other things.
Depending on the field that you work in,
there may be standards for processing.
So, for example, the area where I work,
genomics, there are a lot of
really standard pre-processing techniques
that need to
be applied before you can analyze data.
A critical, critical component is that all
steps should be recorded.
I can't state this strongly enough.
Pre-processing often ends up being the
most
important component of the data analysis
in
terms of effect on the downstream data,
and so, paying attention to all the
steps that you did, is critically
important if you're going to be a a
data scientist who's careful about
understanding what's
really happening in the entire data
processing pipeline.
So I'm going to give you one really quick
example of a processing pipeline,
just to illustrate what I mean by there
being different levels of raw data.
So this is an illumina I seek machine.
So, what this machine can be used to do is
to sequence a DNA, and so,
tha, that sequencing is much, much faster
now than it used to be in the past.
When the original human genome project got
started, it took almost a
decade maybe, and over a billion dollars
to sequence one human genome.
And that same process can now be performed
in about
a week, for about $10,000, using a machine
like this.
So, it's an example of how data are
becoming more and more cheap and easier to
collect.
And so, the way that this machine works in
a very, very rough overview is
you end up with you can imagine how you
could start with fragments of DNA.
So it starts with little fragments of DNA
which are bound to a slide.
So each fragment might be you know, 500
letters long.
So you can think of the, your DNA, as a
string of three billion letters.
And so you take a small chunk of that, 500
letters, and bind it to the slide.
And then there's a chemical process by
which
multiple copies of that same sequence are
made.
And so, what ends up happening is the,
this process per, is performed through
sequencing by synthesis, and so what
happens
is the complimentary base, or the
complimentary letter
to each letter in the sequence that's
attached to this slide, is attached one at
a time, and each different letter, A, C,
T, and G get a different color.
So what happens is, for each little
cluster, you get a color at every
single new, nucleotide that's synthesized,
and so,
those colors will create a series of
images.
And so, for example, when you're
synthesizing the
first nucleotide, you might get this
image, then
this image in the second one, and this
image in the third one, and so forth.
If you zoom in on one specific little dot,
that corresponds to the sequence of
exactly one of these little clusters of
sequences that are exactly the same.
And so, what you can do is you can follow
along, from image to image and see what
the colour is in that image, and in that
image, and in that image, and in that
image.
And what you end up with is for each
image, the color corresponding to each
letter, whichever one is the brightest, is
the one that you assign to that sequence.
So for example, you in the very first
letter for this particular fragment is
going to be
C because you can see that of these four
letters right here, the C is actually the
highest.
And then in the second nucleotide you can
actually see
that the highest letter out of these four,
or the
most bright letter is the G, and so the
next
letter that we'd assign would be a G and
so forth.
So, the final thing that you end up with
is something like
this FASTQ file that I've showed a couple
of times in the class.
So the FASTQ file is a text file where,
for each of these little fragments that
you got
on the, on the plate, you actually see a
specific set of letters A, Cs, Ts and Gs.
So you can think about the raw data being
at several different steps.
So the raw data might be these image files
down here.
So, you have to process those image files
in
order to get these profiles here, for each
different fragment.
And then after you have the profiles, you
have to process those in order to
make predictions about which letter should
go into
the sequences that actually end up right
here.
So any of these stages could be considered
raw, and in each of these stages, there
are a number of computational steps that
can
have a major impact that must be applied.
And so, one thing to keep in mind when
you're doing data analysis is,
frequently, you might end up analyzing
these
so called reads that come off this
machine.
Or you might even a, analyze something
that's downstream, say
some counts based on adding up some of
those reads.
When you do that, you're glossing over the
fact that all of these processing steps
happen beforehand.
And so, those processing steps can have a
major impact.
And part of this course is sort of
understanding what
those processing steps are, so you can
make sure that your
analysis isn't being driven by artifacts
caused by the way
that you went from the raw data to the
title data.
So that's what getting data is all about,
is
taking raw data and turning it into
process data.
