Welcome to getting data.
This is one of the more unique course in
our data-science track.
And so I wanted to get you a little bit of
motivation and pre-requisites
for the course, so you get an idea what
we're going to be talking about.
This course covers the basic ideas behind
getting your
data ready to actually perform a data
analysis on it.
So this is a step that's often skipped
when you're, taking a class on machine
learning or statistics that sort of assume
that the data are already ready to use.
They're in a nice, neat format.
So this class deals with the nitty gritty
of finding the raw data in whatever form
they are whether they're in a database or
in a raw image file or something else.
And extracting that data out and then
there's also concern with tidy
data principles, taking that raw data
that's really complicated and maybe not
formatted so nicely and putting them into
a nice tidy format that
makes it easy to use them and you're
actually doing data analysis.
It also covers practical implementation
through a range of R packages, we'll
be talking about a big range of R packages
in this class.
This course assumes that you've taken the
Data Scientist's Toolbox and
in-, and installed all the relative tools,
and also that you've
taken the R programming class, or some
relat-, similar class so
that you have enough R programming
background not to be intimidated.
It would also be useful if you've taken
some exploratory data analysis.
And also maybe the reporting and data and
reproducible research class.
Exploratory data analysis is relevant,
because you might want to
plot some of the data while you're doing
data cleaning.
And reporting data and reproducible
research cover creating scripts that will
reproduce your analysis, which is an
important component in cleaning data.
But these aren't required for you to be
able to follow the course.
So what you wish data would look like is
something like this.
So you can see here this is a Excel file
where you actually have in every
single row, you have one observation, and
in
every single column you have exactly one
variable.
And so it's neatly organized into
something that
looks like a matrix which makes it very
easy
to import this into R or another
programming
language and start to perform more
complicated statistical analysis.
But as we saw in the data scientist
toolbox, real data looks much different
than that.
So, for example, this is a, a FASTQ file.
And in the FASTQ file, you might
be interested in actually extracting, sort
of, the
sequence information from one line of this
file,
or from each separate line of the file.
And so, to get out that sequence
information, you actually have to parse
this raw text file and extract out the
bits you actually care about.
And so, one of the steps that sort of
doing, getting data is actually getting
into these raw files, figuring out their
structures,
and being able to extract the relevant
bits.
Another thing that might happen is that
you might get data that's actually quite
neatly structured, so, for example, this
is the, data from the API of Twitter.
And so, what it is is it's actually data
that is formatted in Json format.
And so Json formatted data is actually
quite neat and organized, very easy to
distribute,
but it's very hard to actually use
to do downstream analysis in many
programming languages.
So, you might want to re-organize that
data in such a
way that it's easy to analyze and
[INAUDIBLE] to it.
And so that's another component of getting
and cleaning any data.
Finally you might have situations like
this where you have instructions like
take one tablet by mouth and take one half
tablet with grapefruit juice.
These are actually free text instructions
that you might want to be
able to get into that free text and
extract out A
little piece of that information, say how
many cabas they've been
instructed to take, and categorize that by
each record that you've collected.
So the data might also be somewhere that
you have to extract it out.
So even if the data is in a structured
environment
or in an environment where you might
want to analyze it.
So, here are a couple of examples.
These are both databases.
So MySQL and MongoDB are 2 very popular,
free databases
where data might be stored, say for
example, if you're working
in a company and you might want to be able
to
go into that database, collect some of
that data in its
raw form and then process it in such a way
that you can do analysis maybe on some
subset of the
data, or create an algorithm that will
allow you to
apply, predictive analytics to data that
you collect from these databases.
So again the data maybe in all sorts of
places.
It doesn't necessarily have to be data
that's sitting in a file in your computer.
So for example, this is a get request
which is [UNKNOWN] we'll talk about in
this class.
It's a request to try to get some
information off of a website.
And so in this case it's getting
information from an
api, a Twitter api about specific tweets
or specific users.
Data might also be available from other
websites so this is a website that we
will see relatively frequently in this
class
which is the open data website for
Baltimore.
So this contains a bunch data sets that
very interesting and useful for
you to be able to analyze and they are all
free which is great.
But you have to be able to get them off
the
web, get them from the api or one of the
downloadable files.
Cleaned them up so that you can do
downstream analysis on them.
So if you think about the whole pipeline
of going from
sort of a raw data set you might have in
database all
the way to the end, a sort of the data
that you
might communicate to a colleague or a
collaborator or a business partner.
There's actually a large number of steps
and so
what ends up happening in most statistics
or machine
learning classes; they focus on this data
analysis step;
which is an important component of the
data, processing pipeline.
But they tend to skip over this early
stage, where you
actually go from raw data to tidy data And
that turns
out to be one of the more important
components in any
kind of environment where the data aren't
necessarily already pre-tidy for you.
So, any kind of start up company, or most
large corporation.
Or any, almost every academic environment.
You'll want to know how to actually get at
the raw
data, itself, so that you can do the
cleaning yourself.
So you understand the principles of what's
going on.
And that's what this class is all about.
