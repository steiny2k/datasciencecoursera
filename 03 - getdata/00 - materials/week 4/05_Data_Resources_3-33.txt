This lecture is just to point you to some
data resources so you might be able to get
some
free data and use some analyses if you
don't
happen to have any at the organization
that you're at.
So, this website consists of, of data from
a variety of national organizations.
So we can start of with the United Nations
data sets which are at this website.
And then you can find data that are
available from
the United States at data.gov and you can
go to
this blog post to find a bunch of other
cities
and states within the United States that
have open data.
There's also a lot more information on a,
a variety of other countries.
And this website down
here, data.gov/opendatasites actually
gives information
on data sites for other countries all
around the world.
So that's a good place to start if you
don't
know if your country has an open
government data site.
Gapminder is another website that has a
lot
of data about development, in particular
in human health,
and so there's a large number of data-sets
that are available on that website, which
is gapminder.org.
You can also get survey data from the
United States.
This website here gives you a lot of
information about how
do you actually access the surveys and
process them in R.
So, it's actually really nice because the
surveys are often very big and unwieldy
and this website gives you a lot of
information on how to access them.
The Infochimps Marketplace has a bunch of
different datasets which you can sort by
various
different tags and you can identify data
sets that might be of interest to you.
Some of them are free and some of them
cost money.
Kaggle is another place that you can go to
for data sets.
So Kaggle is a company that offers data
science competitions and they often
have very interesting data sets that they
make available as part of those
competitions.
So they're good for practice but they're
also good for potentially
discovering new interesting things that
can help companies solve real problems.
There's also some collections that have
been
put together by a famous data scientists.
So these are several data scientists,
Hilary
Mason Jeff Hammerbacher and others who
have
put together data sets that are research
quality and that might be useful for you.
These all come from this blog post which
talks about several other data sets.
They're curated by other data scientists
as well.
There are also a large variety of other,
more specialized collections.
So for example, this Stanford Large
Network Data archive has a
large number of data sets that focus on
network data, machine
learning, the UCI Machine Learning archive
has a variety of data
sets that can be used to practice your
classification or prediction.
The CMU Statlib is one of the most
famous canonical sets of data sets that
are available.
Gene expression omnibus, is focused on
data sets
that come from human genomic experiments
or other organismal
genomic experiments, and then there's data
from the
archive or public data sets on Amazon Web
Services.
Finally, there are a large number of API's
that you've now
learned how to use, and through the course
of this class.
And so for example, there's specific
packages such as the Twitter package.
Which can be used to access the Twitter
API in an
easier way than trying to set up a, an
application yourself.
You can, similarly, get access to figshare
data or to
data from publications like PLoS1, r Open
Science has a large
number of very nice packages that allow
you to access
data from a variety of sources that are
focused on academics.
There's also dedicated R packages for
Facebook and Google maps.
All of these mean that there's really no
excuse to not be able to
find real data to focus on any project
that you might be interested in.
