Hi, my name is Brian Cathow, and
welcome to the Statistical Inference
Coursera Data Science class.
In this class,
we're going to learn about the process
of formal statistical inference.
So I define statistical
inference as the process of
generating conclusions about
a population from a noisy sample.
Without statistical inference we're
simply living within our data.
With statistical inference we're
trying to generate new knowledge.
We're trying to extend beyond our data,
to a population to get answers.
With statistical inst,
inference, our estimators have actual
things that they're estimating.
And in fact,
I would say statistical inference is
the only formal system of
inference that we have.
Let me give you some examples, and
hopefully, you'll understand
what I'm talking about.
Consider trying to predict who's going
to win an election on Election Day,
given a sample of likely voters today.
Well, there,
our sample is a noisy data set.
Some people might not actually
vote on Election Day,
some people might change their mind as
to what they're going to say now, or
some people might even be
deliberately misleading.
So we'd like to try to draw
together all that uncertainly, and
use that to predict who's
going to win on Election Day.
When a weatherman tells you the
probability that it rains tomorrow is 70%,
they're trying to use the historical data
and partic, particularly the most recent
data, to predict tomorrow's weather and
actually attach a probability to it.
That probability talks about, it,
it, it refers to a population.
An example that's very close to
the research I do, is trying to
predict what areas of the brain activate
when we put them in an fMRI scanner.
In that case, people are doing a task
while they're in the sta, in the scanner.
For example, tapping their fingers,
something like that.
And we like to compare when they're
tapping their finger to when they're not,
and try to figure out what areas of the
brain are associated with finger tapping.
That's just one example there.
Again, these are all very different
aspects of statistical inference.
They're very different in the ways
in which we're thinking about, and
modeling the randomness.
And, so, I, you know,
I think you'll probably get the sense that
statistical inference is a kind of
challenging subject because of that.
One thing I want to mention briefly, and
hopefully get out of the way as early as
possible, is the idea that there's many
different modes of statistical inference.
And, in fact,
there's a recent New York Times article
that described the difference
between so-called Bayesians and
frequentists, two different
kinds of inferential paradigms.
And I think, when you first come into
this discipline, you might even be
surprised that there can even be more
than one way to think about statistics.
But in fact,
even among so-called Bayesians and even
among so-called frequentists, there's all
different variations and shades of grays.
And there's many Bayesians that I
would say just really behave like
frequentists and so on.
So, what we're going to do in this class
to make it as straightforward as possible
is to predict, pri, pick a very particular
paradigm, this frequentist paradigm
that's the one that's the most commonly
taught in introductory statistics classes.
And the reason I elected to do this is
because it's the most likely one for
you to have encountered,
to that you'll encounter in practice.
And also, I think once you develop
some of these fundamentals,
you'll be able to extend this knowledge
to lots of different areas, and
you'll be able to build on it, so
we want to build a good foundation,
we're going to do it with sort
of frequency style thinking.
What I mean by frequency style thinking is
we're going to think of probability like
how we think of gambling.
So I'm going to think the probability that
a coin lin, winds up as heads is going to
be when I, if I were to flip it, maybe
infinitely many times, and there's all
this randomness that I'm thinking about in
the coin flip, and the proportion of heads
would really define this sort of intrinsic
probability of a head to the coin.
That's a frequentist style of thinking.
It's sort of the idea that we can
repeat an experiment over and over and
over again, and
the percentage of times that something
happens defines that population parameter.
There in, there are, there is more than
one way to think about probability,
more than one way to
think about inference.
But we're going to focus on specifically
frequency style inference like that, like
the coin flipping and all the gambling
experiments that we're very familiar with.
And, we're going to leave all
that other stuff to the side.
In the notes, I give you some examples of
all different sorts of topics that you
can try to build on after you've mastered
some of the tools from this class.
Let me give you just a quick example.
There's a thriving community now
that's trying to figure out how we
can really infer causation,
not just association, but
real causation using
noisy statistical data.
That's a very deep problem.
And what they like to do is enumerate
the assumptions and the, and
the set of tools and statistical
study designs that will lead us to
develop causality rather than association.
That requires us to do things like
define what we mean by something causing
something else.
It's a very deep field.
At any rate I,
that's one example of the couple I give
in the notes where you can build on this.
For example, survey sampling,
epidemiological studies, and so on.
But again, what I'd like to do in a very
short class like this is really focus on
building our foundation in basic,
frequency-style probability models and
testing.
So I'd like to welcome
to you to the class.
The way that you want to
think about this class is,
if you're sort of keeping pace with it,
it's a four-week class.
But if you're struggling with
some of the concepts, don't feel
badly about having to, you know,
extend this class out, take it twice.
You know, this is deep stuff,
and it's unusual.
I think, and, and it's not the math,
and it's not the, you know, I know many
mathematicians who, who really struggle
when they first start thinking about
statistical inference, because it's just a
different way of thinking about the world.
So think of this as a four-week class, and
if you're getting it, if you're not,
you know, take a little bit more time.
There's four quizzes, there's one project.
The project, I really think,
drives home the idea,
some of the central ideas of inference.
I hope that you would spend a fair
amount of time thinking about
the project because it really drives home
what we mean by sampling distributions and
what is meant by frequency syle,
style statistical inference.
The quizzes will be auto graded.
They're ideally due at
the end of each week but
you can attempt all the quizzes
from the start of the class.
I've put out some homework problems and
I've linked those homework problems to
the specific quiz questions, so you can
practice before you even try the quiz.
So welcome to the class, I'm really
enthusiastic about teaching you.
I really like inference,
it's my favorite subject.
I've been studying
statistical inference for
probably 15 years now, and every time I
think about it, I learn something new.
And so I hope you can really
dive into this deep and
incredibly important subject with me.
