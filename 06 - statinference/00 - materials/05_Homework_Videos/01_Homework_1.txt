Hi, this is Brian and I would like to
talk to you guys a little bit about
the homework and
maybe just work through it a little bit.
So make sure first you
tried the homework and
then if you're having some trouble,
then you tried looking at the hints and
if you're still having some trouble,
you tried looking at the answers.
Or maybe you've done all of this.
And then now, I'd like to explain how
I would solve some of the problems.
So this is the homework.
It's an HTML file.
You can look at it on the internet.
It's hosted on GitHub.
And we'll teach you in the data products
class how to make things like this.
Okay, and in fact, I give you a little
bit of information about the slides.
If you have a correction on the homework,
which is always good for
me because I make a lot of typos and
things like that.
Remember to submit them as
GitHub pull requests and
then I'll pull them in when I can.
So consider influenza epidemics for
two parent heterosexual families.
Suppose that the probability is 15% that
at least one of the parents has contracted
the disease, 10% that the father has
contracted the disease, while 9% for
the mother.
What's the probability that both
have contracted the disease?
Okay, well, let me, flip over to my notes
and I already wrote some stuff down.
So I'm going to let A be the event
that the father contracts the disease,
B be the event that the mother
contracts the disease.
And I've written out, well,
that the probability of A,
we were given was 10% or 0.10.
The probability of B was the probably that
the mother contracted the disease, and
we were given that, that was 0.09.
And probably A union B,
the probability that at least one
of the family members that have
contracted the disease is 0.15.
That's this probably right here.
Now we need to get
the probability of A intersect B.
[SOUND] Okay.
So we have a rule that
relates these probabilities
to the probability of A intersect B.
Remember that the probability
of A union B.
Right?
That's this, both these circles together,
is equal to the probability of A.
So we add that guy in once,
plus the probability of B.
So we add that circle in once and
then, minus we've added
this middle part in twice.
So we have to subtract it out.
Probability of A intersect B.
Well now, we can plug in.
So we have oh,
that didn't help, there we go.
[SOUND] We have 0.15 was the probability
of A union B, 0.10 is the probability for
the father, 0.09 was
the probability of the mother, and
probability of A intersect B
was the thing that we want.
The probability that both
contract the disease.
Well this was equal to 0.19,
0.15 minus probability of A intersect B.
And then,
if I subtract my 0.19 from both sides,
I get negative 0.04.
And then if I get rid of
my sign on both side,
I get to the probability of
A intersect B is 4%, all right?
Let me go back and check.
[SOUND] I'm going to click 4%, and
then I'm going to click Submit.
Yay.
So let's move on to the next one.
Okay.
A random variable, X, is uniform,
which is a uniform is a box
from 0 to 1 of height 1.
And it gives the function, but
I don't need the function.
It's a box.
What's the median expressed
to two decimal places?
All right.
[SOUND] So
the density looks something like this.
Here's 0, here's 1.
There's the density, the height is 1.
Now, let me just double check that
this is an appropriate density.
So the area of a box, the, the density,
a density has to have area 1.
So the area of a box is
the length times the height.
In this case, the length is 1,
the height is 1.
So the area is 1.
So it's a nice density.
Density.
Now we need to find the median.
Well, what is the median?
The median is the point along the x-axis
of the density such that 50%
of the density lied below it.
So, if, just draw a different den, looking
density, something silly like that.
The median would be the point,
exactly the point X, so that,
if we move this line a little bit to the
right, we'd get more than 50% of the area.
And if we move the [INAUDIBLE],
the line a little bit to the left,
we get less than 50% of the area.
So the median, the population, so
again, we're talking about density so
this is the population median.
So of course, you know what the sample
median is, that's the middle of your data,
that's the point such that 50%
of your data lies below it and
50% of your data lies above it.
But, we're talking about inference, so we
need to talk about population quantities,
so this is a conceptually
infinite population of data,
and this is saying 50% of it lies
below it, and 50% lies above it.
It's pretty easy in this case.
We don't have to really do any work,
right?
We know that the median in, of the box,
the point that would put equal
area into your side would have
to be right here in the middle.
That would be 0.5.
So let's check on that.
And I want to select, there's my answer.
Now, there's some rigmarole about it being
expressed to two decimal places, but
that doesn't matter so
much because it's multiple choice.
So we hit Submit.
And check, yay.
Okay, and let me show it,
just click on the show answer and
it describes a little bit
about the calculation.
Okay, let's move on to the next one.
Okay, moving on to the next one,
you are playing a game with a friend where
you flip a coin and if it comes up heads,
you give her X dollars and if it comes
up tails, she gives you Y dollars.
When the coin isn't
necessarily a fair coin,
the odds that the coin is heads is d.
So instead of giving the probability,
I give you the odds here.
And the question is,
what is your expected earnings?
Yowza.
Okay, let's work through this.
[SOUND] So
I've written some stuff out here,
d is the odds of a head from the coin.
You get negative x if it comes up heads,
[SOUND] and
you get y if it comes up tails.
So you lose X dollars if
it comes up heads and
you gain Y dollars if it comes up tails.
So let's set w be your earnings.
Okay, so w can take the pot, potential
values, losing X dollars if it comes up
heads, and it can take the potential value
gaining Y dollars if it comes up tails.
So the probability of w, the probability
that takes these various values would be,
let's just label it P for x.
And the, 1 minus P for tails.
So P is the probability of a head for
the coin and
1 minus P is the probability of tail.
Now the expected value
calculation is just the sum.
So w is your earnings what we care about
so your expected earnings is just the sum
of your possible earnings times
the probability that it takes it.
So it would be negative x times
P plus y times 1 minus P.
Okay.
And I think that's probably actually
enough to solve the problem but
we need, let's get all the way to the end.
So, but unfortunately,
the problem didn't give us P,
the probability of a head it
gave us the odds of a head.
So remember that the odds O is related
to the probability as by
being P over 1 minus P.
And then there's this one to one
relationship between odds and probability.
So we can back solve for
probability from knowing the odds.
So in that case P.
Is, oh, and
I should just write d for the odds.
d is the odds.
d equals p over 1 minus p.
So if I back-solve for the probability,
I get d over 1 plus d.
And then if I just calculate
what 1 minus p is,
that's equal to 1 minus
d over 1 plus d which is
equal to 1 plus d over
1 plus d minus d over
1 plus d which is equal
to 1 over 1 plus d.
Okay, so let's plug this into there and
this into there and
I get minus x times d over 1 plus d and
plus y times 1 over 1 plus d.
Okay.
Great.
And this is kind of a famous problem
because if you want the, if you,
if you want the coin to be fair then,
you know, if, if you were given x and y,
if you wanted the coin to be fair and
or if you want the game to be fair.
If you wanted to have expected
value zero you could solve that and
figure out what value of d it has to take.
Or on the other hand, if you know d and
you want the game to be fair,
you can figure out what relationship x and
y have to have and
that's related to one of the,
the quiz questions.
So it looks like this one is
the one that I wrote down.
Minus X times d over 1 plus d,
plus y over 1, over 1 plus d.
And let's submit.
And that's correct.
All right, moving onto the next one.
A random variable takes the value
minus 4 with probability point 2 and
1 with probability point 8.
What is the variance of
this random variable?
Ouch.
Okay I'm kind of sadistic with
these homework problems but let's,
let's work on this one.
So minus 4 with probability .2 and
1 with a probability .8 so
minus 4 with probability .2 and
1 with a probability .8.
So these are the possible
values x can take and
these are the probability x takes them.
Well to calculate the variance
what we should do is calculate
the expected value of x squared and
subtract off the expected value of x.
Quantity squared.
Okay, so x squared,.
That's 16 and 1.
Okay, so remember, expected value of
a random variable, so expected value
of x squared is the values it can take
times the probability that it takes them.
So 16 times 0.2 plus 1 times 0.8.
Well, 16 point, times 0.2 is
3.2 and plus 1, 1 times .8 is .8,
so expect a value of x squared is 4 and
then expect a value of x is equal to,
the possible values x can take,
times the probability that takes it.
So, minus 4 times 0.2,
plus 1 times 0.8.
Well, that's equal to minus 0.8 plus 0.8.
Oh good, it's 0.
So, if I plug in to my formula up here,
I get 4 for
that minus 0 squared, which is 4.
Okay, let's try it.
4 submit.
All right.
Okay, let's do the next one.
If x bar and y bar are sample means
comprised of n iid random variables
arising from distributions having
means mu x and mu y respectively, and
a common variance of sigma squared what's
the variance of X bar minus Y bar?
Okay.
This seems like a very
confusing problem but
let's talk our way through it because
this is quite, quite important problem.
So let's orient ourselves because this
is important for us to think about.
If I have a density that has mean mu x and
it has variance, the sort of spread
of it is governed by sigma squared.
That's a population distribution.
That's assuming that if I draw data from
this population that their probabilities,
the probability they take various values
to be governed by this general law, this,
this general density distribution,
that is sort of a conceptual
component of a population.
Maybe if we were to collect an infinite
amount of data we would know this density
exactly.
If I were to draw n observations from
this density and take their mean.
I get another random variable, and
that's a single draw from another density.
One that's the density of the average of
end draws from this existing density.
And we know a lot of
things about that density.
For example, that it is centered at
the same place, but it's shrunken in,
it's compressed around mu x a little
bit more, and that's just saying that.
X bar is a good estimator of mu,
it's a better
estimator of mu than just a random
observation from the original population.
The average of n observations from the
original population is a better estimator
because the density governing
the probabilities associated with x bar
is more shrunken around the thing
that you're trying to estimate.
And in fact we know how to relate
the variance of this dens, dis,
density, the density of X bar to
the variance of the population.
The variance of the original
population is sigma squared,
then the variance of X bar is
equal to sigma squared over n.
So the result of collecting
n observations and
taking a mean is to get a new random
variable, the sample mean, whose,
whose variance is now
shrunken by a factor of n.
Which is a good thing, right?
And it's also centered
around what you want,
the density is centered around
what you'd like to estimate.
And then similarly, the variance of
Y bar is going to be sigma squared
over n because we assumed that the, the
population that the Y's were drawn from
had the same variances as the population
of the X's were drawing from.
Okay, so now let's talk about
the variance of, X bar minus Y bar.
Well if, so we said that the, the,
the data were independent that the x's
were independent of the y's, which is good
because that means that our variance adds
and so we can write variance of X bar
and then variance of Y bar and you,
you be inclined to put a minus sign here.
But that would not be right and
it's a plus sign.
And the reason is because this.
Think about it this way.
If I were to do variance of X
bar plus negative Y bar and
my X bar and Y bar are independent,
then that would be the variance of X bar
plus the variance of negative Y bar.
And then if I were to pull out my
negative 1, it gets squared, right?
Remember that rule, if we pull something
out of a variance, it gets squared,
and then a square of
a negative 1 will be positive.
And, so anyway it's a long and
short is if you subtract two
things their variance still adds.
Now if the two things are an independent,
then we may have other stuff over
here that we have to add in.
Subtract off in fact in this case.
But these things are independent so
there is no co variance from our
other thing we have to subtract off.
Okay.
So let's plug in,
we have sigma squared over n for X bar,
sigma squared over n for Y bar, for
the variance of Y bar and they add,
so, it's equal to 2 σ squared over n.
And so, let's go back and
try that as an answer, 2 σ squared over n.
Submit answer.
Alright.
Okay, only a couple left.
Let X bar, let X be a random variable
having standard deviation σ.
What can be said about X over σ?
And so, we have some things to rule out.
Well, nothing, it must have variance 1, it
must have mean 0, it must have variance 0.
Let's try some things.
So, here we have, what,
what we're given is that variance
of X is equal to σ squared.
So, that the deviation of
a random variable X is σ.
So, let's think about X over, X over σ.
Its expected value, remember, we can
factor things out of expected values,
that's expected value X over σ.
And we don't know anything about
what expected value of X is.
And we don't know anything about σ,
other than it's strictly positive, so,
we can't say anything about the mean of X.
It could be anything.
Okay, now,
what about the variance of X over σ?
Well, remember, when we pull a factor
out of a variance, it gets squared, so,
that's 1 over σ squared
times the variance of X.
Oh, but we wrote that down over there,
that's σ squared.
So, it's σ squared over σ squared,
which is one.
Well, that was one of the answers,
that it has to have variance 1.
So, let's try that.
It must have variance 1, submit.
There you go.
All right, let's keep going on.
Second to last, penultimate problem.
If a continuous density that
never touches the horizontal
axis is symmetric about zero,
can we say its associated median is zero?
So, this is,
this is a little bit of an unfair problem.
And, if you didn't get this,
certainly, don't feel badly about it.
And, I'll tell you why.
So, what it, so, here, we have a density.
And here, I've said,
it never touches zero.
And it's symmetric about
the vertical axis.
So, what mean, what that means is that,
if I draw it like that, then it has
to look like that on the other side.
If I were to draw it,
if I were to draw something like this,
let me see if now, I can, it's gotta
look like that on the other side.
And so, to me, it looks pretty clear that
this density has to have median zero,
because the amount of
area that's on this side
has to be the same as the amount of area
on this side, because it's flipped over.
It's, it's symmetric.
Now, the reason about
the sort of rigmarole, and
the problem about never touching zero,
and, and that's what makes it confusing.
I think that's why there's
a little bit of an unfair problem.
I, I had it in the actual
quizzes at one point.
And, it caused a lot of problems, so,
now I've put it in to homework, so,
at least we can discuss it.
And some of the students said, when I
put it in to homework I had it without
this caveat that the density
had to be touching zero.
And students came up with this example,
which is really clever of course.
Imagine that density it
looks something like this.
[SOUND] Okay.
Now, here, it's, it's,
it's strictly zero right here.
Here's zero.
Now, remember,
what's the median of a density?
The median is that point such that 50%
lies below it, and 50% lies above it.
Well, this, I didn't draw it perfectly,
but I'm, I'm trying to suggest that this
and this are mirror images of each other
around this vertical axis,
but it's zero between.
So, any point along,
between here any point between where
the density start rising above zero again.
Any point would be such that 50%,
because right?
50% lies there and 50% lies there, so,
any point in here would be a median.
And they all said, well,
how do you define the median in that case?
Is it necessarily zero?
Is it the midpoint of all the potential
medians in the, in there?
Or, is it the left most median,
or is it the right most median?
And that was kind of confusing, but
I also thought it was an incredibly clever
point made by many of
the students in the class.
So, I thought I'd raise it up,
and give it as one of the,
give it as one of the homework questions,
so, at least we could discuss it.
So, I'm going to put yes here and
submit, and then, I just want to show you
the answer because I actually go through
some of this discussion, I actually put in
that this is a surprisingly hard problem.
It seems, my intention was for
it to be an easy problem.
My original intention was, yes, if
a density is symmetric about zero, then,
its median is zero because 50% lies
below zero and 50% lies above zero.
But there's this caveat that
if it's flat on the horizontal
axis right around zero, then,
well that causes, that causes problem.
So, I describe this caveat a little bit
in the homework in the homework problem.
And if you miss this little
kind of subtle point of nuance,
I mean this is really not in a,
in a, a major important point.
What I'm hoping you'll
know is what a median is.
Basically, what is, what does it mean for
a point to be the me, a population median?
And it's just that point such that
50% of the density lies below it and
50% lies above it.
All right, final problem, and
thank goodness it involves some computing.
So, I'm giving you a probability mass
function but one that's just defined.
X takes the values two through five and
the probability that X takes
these values is .1, .2, .3, .4, and
then, it says what's the variance?
So x, takes the values 2 : 5, [SOUND] and
p the probability it takes them,
[SOUND] is if I recall it was
1 : 4 divided by 10 [SOUND].
Let's double check.
There's p point .1, .2, .3, .4.
And, let's just double tech, oops,
the possible values the probabilities
have to sum up to one,
so, there, and then, if I,
[SOUND] there's x two, three, four,
five and the probability that
it takes it one .1, .2, .3, .4.
Well, what's the variance?
It's the expected value of x squared minus
expected value of x quantity squared.
So, expected value of X
squared is sum x squared the,
the x squared value times the probability
that it takes them times p.
Expected value of x is sum x
times p the positive value
is x takes time
the probability it takes them
raised to the second power because I want
expected value of x quantity squared.
That works out to be one.
Okay, so hopefully,
one is a potential answer.
I see right here that one is a potential
answer, so, I'm going to do it and submit.
There we go.
So, I just want to end with a couple
of comments on the homework.
You know, obviously,
it looks like I'm going through it kind of
fast if you, are struggling with it.
And remember, I wrote the actual
homework problems, so, of course,
I can go through it fast.
This is kind of complicated stuff,
but it's also important stuff.
And so keep plugging away.
I think the, I made the homework
a little bit harder than the quizzes.
So, that you know,
maybe it'll pump up your muscles for
when you go take the quizzes,
it'll be, it'll be easy.
I remember when I used
to do swim practice,
we used to swim with all this
stuff dragging on us, so,
that when we tried to race it
seemed like we were a lot lighter.
It didn't work for me, but,
nonetheless, maybe it'll work for you.
All right, so, keep plugging away at
that homework and I'll post a video
about the second homework set,
similarly working through the problems.
