Hi, this is Brian and
welcome to Homework 2 for Stat Inference.
I'm going to work through the problems
here and you, make sure you tried them
first and looked at the hints and looked
at the answers and then watch this video.
The, and again, I'm going to teach you
how to create this kinds of slides in
the data products class if
you're doing the specialization.
So the first problem is one of these
basic conditional probability problems.
It's sort of like a little bit of,
probability calisthenics
just to warm us up.
So what it asks, and this probably
is better in homework 1 but, I,
I think it kind of crept into
homework 2 as a legacy issue.
So the probability that a manuscript
gets accepted to a journal is 12%.
However, given that
a revision is asked for,
the probability that it
gets accepted is 90%.
Is it possible that the probability that
a manuscript has a revision asked for
is 20%?
Okay, let me switch over to my handwritten
notes and then we'll try and answer this.
Let's let A be, A be the event
that the article is accepted and
B be the event that
a revision is asked for.
And if I go back to my numbers,
they gave me probability of A is 12%.
And they gave me
the probability of A given B,
the probability of accepted given
a revision is asked for, is 90%.
And the question is asking,
could it be that probability B is 20%?
Well, the probability of
A intersect B is equal
to the probability of A given B times
the probability of B, which is 0.90.
And, we're hypothesizing that probability
of B could be 0.20 which is 0.18.
So can it be the case that A intersect B,
this area is 0.18 when we know
that the probability of A,
[SOUND] this whole area right here
including the red area, is 0.12.
Well that's not possible because the red
areas can contained inside the green area.
So it has to be smaller than 0.12.
So this isn't possible.
So let's try that out as an,
as an answer and see how it goes.
No, it's not possible,
and submit, and okay.
And, then, if I click Show Answer,
it'll actually just go through the a,
the work there.
And then, by the way, you can always click
on Show Hint and it gives you some basic,
you know, basic starting point for
the problem.
Now the next problem is kind of important
because it's getting us up to the point
where we can work with
standard normal calculations.
And non-standard normal
calculations which is
sort of an important part
of being a data scientist.
The, these should be fairly natural
things to work with for people.
So it says suppose the number
of web hits to a particular site
are approximately normally distributed
with a mean of 100 hits per day and
a standard deviation of 10 hits per day.
What's the probability that a given
day has a fewer than 93 hits per
day expressed as a percentage
to the nearest percentage point?
So let me switch over to my notes,
and I'm going to draw,
[SOUND] I'm going to draw
the relevant normal distribution.
So here it is, it's 100 is the mean, and
it wants to know what's the probability
of 93 or fewer hits per day.
So, it wants that area.
We need to figure out how many standard
deviations below the mean, 93 is.
So we do that by taking
93 subtracting 100 and
dividing by the standard deviation,
which is 10.
Which we get negative 0.7.
So let's, you know, so
we don't know that standard normal
quantile off the top of our head.
So, why don't we go to our studio and
type in pnorm negative 0.7.
So, if I type in pnorm negative 0.7,
then I get 24%.
I would also add that, [SOUND] or
I can just do this calculation for you.
You don't actually have to
convert it to standard devia,
to standard normal quantiles.
So as an example, if I were to just type
in pnorm 93, where the mean is 100 and
the standard deviation is 10, it's
going to give me the exact same answer.
The, probably the most common mistake you
would make on this one is to accidentally
do pnorm 0.7 by itself,
which is 0.7 standard deviations
above the mean and lower.
So that would be this probability [SOUND]
right there which so 107 and lower.
Okay?
So that's an important,
that's an important distinction.
24%, submit, and there we go.
So this homework problem
is a base problem and
it corresponds pretty closely
to an example quiz question.
Now I've kind of made, marked some of the
correspondence between the quiz questions
and the homework problems and the quizzes.
So look for that.
And it says, suppose 5% of housing
projects have issues with asbestos.
The sensitivity of a test for asbestos
is 93% and the specificity is 88%.
What's the probability that
a housing project has no asbestos
given a negative test expressed as
a percentage of blah, yadda, yadda, yadda.
So I've gone ahead and
written out the information here.
A is the event that the,
house has asbestos.
D plus is the positive test.
D minus is the negative test.
And what I've been given is this
marginal probability of a house
having asbestos is 5%.
The sensitivity of the test, which is
the probability of a positive test,
given that the house has asbestos is 93%.
The negative the specificity, is
the probability that the test is negative,
given that the house does not
have asbestos, and that's 88%.
And we want the probability that
our house does not have asbestos
given that we had a negative test.
That's what we'll be interested in.
Okay, so this is equal to the probability
of A complement intersect D minus times,
or
divided by the probability of D minus,
which is equal to the probability
of D minus given A complement times
the probability of A complement.
And probability of D minus is equal
to the probability D minus intersect
A complement, plus the probability
of D minus intersect A.
And now we can write,
let me start over on this line.
Let me rewrite the numerator.
That's the probability of D minus,
given A complement
which is the specificity times
the probability of A complement.
Divided by the probability of
D minus given A complement,
which is the specificity again times
the probability of A complement plus.
Now let me work with that guy.
That's going to be the probability of D
minus given A times the probability of A.
So let's start plugging in our numbers.
The specificity is 0.88.
The, probability of A is 0.05 so
1 minus that would give
us the probability of A complement so
that's 0.95.
Okay, and then this is just
the numerator repeated again so
that 0.88 times 0.95 plus.
So this is the probability of D.
Of a negative test given
that the house has asbestos.
And that's 1 minus the sensitivity.
So remember,
let me just point this little fact out.
Let me use different letters too,
just so we don't get confused.
So let me say B given C.
I want the probability of B given C,
plus the probability of B complement
given C is equal to 1.
And the way to think about
this is when I condition on
something like given C, then
the probability just works like a normal
probability as long as I have
everything con, just conditioned on C.
So probability of B plus probability
of B complicant, compliment equals 1.
Just because if, if I didn't
condition on C that would be true and
if I condition on C and keep C conditioned
on it every probability, then the,
all the same rules of probability apply.
And that's an easy trick that
you can use to calculate,
calculate conditional probabilities so
you don't get tripped up.
Okay, so, the, in other words, what we,
we want probability D minus given A, but
we have the comp,
the complement probability D plus given A.
But the condition on A is the same so
we can just wine it, 1 minus it so
that's 1 minus 0.93.
So that's 0.07 times
the probability of A which is 0.05.
And this works out to be about 100%.
So I'm going to click on 100%,
and click Submit.
And then let me show you the answer
where I actually plug it into R.
So suppose that the number of
web hits to a particular site
are approximately normally distributed
with a mean of 100 hits per day and
a standard deviation of 10 hits per day.
So the same numbers as earlier.
And what number of web hits
represents the number of days so
that only 5% of the days
have more web hits?
I'm, here's our normal distribution, 100.
We want the point such that,
the area above it is 5%.
Now we could revert everything back
to the standard normal, but again,
we can just use R for these questions.
So we want to do qnorm 0.95,
and that's a subtle point.
Remember, qnorm is always
specified in terms,
in terms of the probability
of the quantile and below.
So just to remind ourselves,
here we wanted the point here, so
that 5% lied above.
But that would mean 95% lied below.
Okay?
So just remember that when
you're dealing with qnorm.
So we want qnorm 0.95.
And if we hit Return,
it's going to give us the standard
normal quantile that we remember, 1.64.
So we want, so we know that,
that quantile is 1.64 standard
deviations away from the mean.
So we could, you know, we could
pretty easily just do that, right?
100 plus 1.644845,
let's just give it the whole thing,
times 10.
So that's 116.44.
That's the answer, but
let's actually just do it how we would do
it [SOUND] without doing that calculation.
So we, we want qnorm 0.95.
And then we'd want to just tell
it that the mean is 100 and
the standard deviation is 10.
And then you can see it
gives the same number.
Okay, so 116.4485, and
it says give it to 3 decimal places.
So that'll be 116.449.
116.449, and I'm going to click Submit.
And there you go.
I think the tolerance is actually
a little bit more forgiving than
what I specify in the question.
Now, here's another take
on the same problem.
So it says, suppose that the number
of web hits to a site is
approximately normally distributed.
Mean of 100, standard deviation of 10.
And it says,
imagine taking a random sample of 50 days,
what's the number of web hits
that would be the point so
that only 5% of averages of 50
days of web traffic has more hits?
So it's kind of like the same problem,
only it's not talking about
a random draw for this population,
it's talking about a random average
of 50 points from this population.
So, so, remember our original
population looks like this.
It has a mean of 100, and Its width is
governed by the standard deviation of 10.
But if we were to take
samples of 50 over and
over again from this distribution,
and take averages,
they would themselves have a distribution
that would also be normally distributed.
And it would be centered
at the same place, 100.
But its standard deviation instead of
being 10, would be 10 over square root 50.
So it's the same exact problem
only now instead of being, having
a standard deviation 10, it's having
standard deviation 10 over square root 50.
Let's try it.
So now we want to do qnorm 0.95
with a mean equal to 100 and
a standard deviation equal to
10 divided by square root 50.
And that gives me 102.33.
And so, let me, I'll copy that number.
Notice it's much closer to 100 than 116,
right?
And that's because that normal
distribution is much more
concentrated about 100.
There I'm going to plug it in and
that's to plenty of decimal places so
it should work.
And there we go.
And then you can see the same,
you can see the same exact code.
So this is a p value question,
a binomial p value question.
So your friend claims that they can
distinguish between cheap and good wines
and so
you randomized a bunch of varieties.
So, you got a cheap Merlot and
an expensive Merlot and
you gave them to your
friend in random order.
And then you got a cheap Chianti and
expensive Chianti and you gave them in
random order, and she got five right
out of six varieties that you tried.
And the question is, what's the chance if
she was just flipping a coin each time,
what was the chance of getting five or
more right?
So five or six?
That would be the p value.
That would be the probability
of getting as or
more extreme evidence in
favor of the alternative,
assuming with the probability calculation
is done, assuming that the null is true.
All right so let's just do that.
So it's, we want the binomial
probability of five or six, okay,
if the coin were fair, out of six trials.
Okay so we want pbinom,
we want five or six, so
I'm going to put four here and
I'll explain why in a second, I want size,
the number of coin flips equal
to six the prob is equal to 0.5,
0.5 and lower.tail equals false.
Sorry, working on a small keyboard here.
There we go.
So it's 11% if I round to
the nearest integer percentage.
The reason I do four is because by
default, pbinom will do four and lower.
But then when I put
lower.tail equals false,
it's going to do strictly
greater than four.
So five or six.
Okay, so as an example,
if I were to do 1 minus pbinom,
where I omitted the lower.tail, it's
going to give me the same number, 11%.
Okay?
So, if I do pbinom four,
it's going to give me four or fewer, and
if I do pbinom four with lower.tail false,
it's going to give me strictly larger
than four, which is five and six.
So, the two, pbinom four without
the lower-tail, and pbi,
binom four plus the lower-tail
have to add up to one.
So, I'm going to go here,
and plug in 11%, and
then I'm going to click Show Answer,
and it's going to show it,
I rounded it to, I guess an extra
decimal place there, so you get 10.9.
Okay, now, let's do this question,
which is a central theorem question.
Consider a uniform distribution, if we
were to take 100 draws, from a uniform
distribution, which has mean 0.5, and
variance 112, so I give you that.
And I take their mean, X bar.
What's the probability of getting
an X bar as large as .51 or
larger, expressed to three decimal places.
So, we don't know much about the means
of uniform distributions, exactly.
But, we do know that they should be
approximately normally distributed.
So, let me switch over to R,
and we'll just try, and do it.
So, recall that my mean was equal to 0.5,
and my st, and my s, my standard devia, or
my sigma let's say,
was equal to sqrt 1 divided by 12.
And then, divided by square root of 100,
which is 10.
Okay?
So, sigma is zero, is about .03.
So, we want, that's the distribution of
the sample average of a hundred uniforms.
It has the same mean,
as the original uniform distribution, but
it's variance is squashed down, a lot by
a factor of, er, it, by a, a factor of
a hundred, and its standard deviation is,
is shrunken by a factor of 10.
Okay, so, I want pnorm.
I want, 0.51, with a mean of, of,
of, of equal to this mean that set,
and my standard deviation equal
to the sigma that I just set.
And I want lower.tail equal to FALSE.
And that gives me about 36%.
And, I'm just going to copy the whole
number, so I get all the decimal places.
And, I submit, and
let me show the answer, just to,
just to make sure, we agree,
and it's the same calculation.
I, I would, I would note, there was
a little bit of poor programming,
I showed in there.
I over wrote the default R function mean,
with a variable called mean, and
that's a bad programming practice.
So, you know, I'm,
I'm actually a little glad I did that, so
I could point this out.
If you need to check whether
R has a function predefined.
So, let me, rem,
let me remove my mean variable.
Now, if I type in mean, you can see
that it's already defined as a variable.
So don't overwrite basic R functions.
That'll mess up your program,
pretty easily.
Okay good.
One that I can just do, if you,
if you roll a standard die, and
if you roll ten standard dice, and
take their average, and
repeat this over and over again, and
construct the histogram,
what would it be centered at?
So, what would this,
the average of ten dice be centered at?
Well, the average of single die rolls,
is, if I were to roll a die over,
and over again, and just get the sort of
uniform distribution that it looks like,
on the numbers one to six,
that history would be centered at 3.5.
But I know the average of ten dice
has to be centered at the same thing,
because the distribution of averages is
centered at the same place as the original
population, and so,
it also has to be centered at 3.5.
Great.
Now, it wouldn't be the same distribution,
right?
But be, because its averages of ten
dice not a histogram of die rolls.
It would be more peaked at around 3.5.
Which is ba, basically, illustrating,
that taking average is a good thing,
it reduces variation in the distribution.
Again, here's another similar problem.
If I roll ten standard dice, and I take
their average, and repeat this over and
over again, and construct the histogram.
What would the, sort of variance of
those distribution of ten dices.
10 dice look like.
Well, again this is just asking what
is the variance of the distribution
of average of 10 die rolls.
And, we know,
that it gets divided by ten, rIght?
The variance scales by N, the standard
deviation scales down by square root N.
Okay, and, we also did a homework problem,
where we calculated what the variance of
die rolls was, and it was about 2.92.
And, if you just go back in the notes,
you'll see that we did that.
So, I know that if the variance
of the distribution of die rolls,
the uniform distribution of
the numbers one to six is 2.92,
then the variance of the distribution
of averages of 10 die rolls,
would have to be 2.92 divided by 10,
so that's .292.
I'm just going to go ahead, and put that
in without doing any R, or anything,
and I'm going to submit it,
and you can see the answer.
Here, when I show the actual calculation,
you can see that I calculate
the the variance of a die roll.
And, that's just reiterating
the calculation done in class.
But the important thing here,
is to remember that we're
dividing this variance by 10.
So, the number of web hits to a webs, to
a site is Poisson with mean 16.5 per day.
What's the probability of getting 20 or
fewer in two days,
expressed as a percentage
to one decimal place?
So, we want 20, or
fewer hits, where we know,
that the rate of hits is 16.5 per day.
Okay.
So, the Poisson probability
function is ppois.
There you go, and we want 20, and
the lambda is 60, is 33, 16.5 times 2.
So, wha, what I mean by that is,
we don't want the number,
we want 20 hits in two days,
we want the probability
of getting 20 hits, or
fewer in two days, not for one day.
And, so, if the rate is 16.5 per day,
then the rate is 33 per two days, okay?
And, so, when you do that,
you get about 1%.
So I want to go here,
plug in 1%, oop,
I don't include the percent sign, and
submit, and then, let me just show
the answer, there you go, right there.
I, I actually do the rounding
in the R command there, so you,
you can see that it's multiplying it times
100 and rounding it to one decimal place.
But, that's all that question
was asking you to do.
But, let me just comment really quickly.
Remember the Poisson distribution
is the distribution on counts, and
it depends on this rate parameter lambda,
that has time units, or
units of whatever is being measured.
So, in this case if we say something
is Poisson with rate 16.5 per day,
and we want to talk about Poisson
probabilities of 10 days or 100 days or
whatever, we need to multiply that lambda
by the number of days we're considering.
So, that's the only little bit of
treachery in this problem, and
you just have to keep track of that.
So, that's the end of this homework.
You've earned yourself a treat.
I'll post another video,
for homework three,
and homework four in
a couple days after that.
