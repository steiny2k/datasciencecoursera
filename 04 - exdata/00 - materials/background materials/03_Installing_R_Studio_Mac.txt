One piece of software that's actually
quite nice
to use and can make R a little bit
nicer to work with is called RStudio,
which
is RStudio is an interactive development
environment or IDE.
That connects with R and provides a lot of
nice features.
That don't come with the, for the basic R
system itself.
So the first thing you need to do of
course is you
need to install R but once you've got R
installed you can download
RStudio and install that if you want, so.
Here I've got the web open and I'm
going to look at I'm going to go to
rstudio.org Org.
You can see that here's a screenshot of
the software.
And you can just click on the Download
RStudio.
And you want to download the RStudio
Desktop.
So it should recognize what kind of
computer you're coming from.
Here it knows, I'm coming from Mac, so I'm
going to download the one that's
recommended for my system.
It works on Windows XP, Vista, and, and
Windows 7.
It also works on a variety of different
Linux formats.
So so
I'll download the Mac version here.
It's fairly quick, and I'll open it up
here.

So so now all you need to do is drag this
into the applications folder.
And I had an older version there
installed, so I'm
going to replace it and you're pretty much
ready to go.
So now I open up the applications folder
go down here and load up
RStudio.
Let's say okay.
And you could see I've got some stuff from
a previous project opened.
But you can see that there are four
windows here and I'll just delete this for
now.
On the bottom left over here, you'll see R
is open.
I'm running 2.15.1.
On the upper left, I got a file open,
which can be used to edit R code.
So, I can type in some R code here.
This is not really that useful.
Anyway, you can see I got R code there.
On the upper right I've got my workspace.
And any objects I've created.
I haven't created any objects.
But, if, if I had, they'd be there.
So, for, for example, I can say, X is R
norm 100 and then I can hit
Apple Enter and it will execute that line.
So, now it created an object
called X.
it's, you can see it's in the workspace.
There's a little summary.
It's a numeric vector with a 100 length
100.
I could have created like a list, for
example.
[SOUND].
Hit Apple Enter, it'll execute and you can
see it's down at the bottom
left over here and also on the top right
it's in the workspace browser.
And then on the bottom right here you've
got your file system, which has your
files,
you can also.
If you make any plots they'll appear here,
so for example I could say.
Hist.x and you'll create a little
histogram and
then a plot appears in the lower right.
If you want information about packages,
these
are the packages that I have installed.
And the ones in the checkbox, the
checkboxes,
are the packages that are loaded right
now.
I could ask for help for anything it will
appear here.
So I can say help, you know, hist.
And help will appear right here.
So it's quite a nice little tool for using
R.
And I recommend it, I think it'd be,
it's quite, it'll be quite useful for this
class.
So check it out, it's RStudio.
