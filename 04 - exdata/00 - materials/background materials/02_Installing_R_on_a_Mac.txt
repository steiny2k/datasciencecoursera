Hey everyone.
I just wanted to make a quick video about
how to install R on a Mac.
So it's fairly straightforward.
And the steps are pretty simple.
So, first I want to go to [UNKNOWN]
and download R for the Mac.
So, here, that's this link right here.
If you download, if you click on it, it'll
take you to the R for Mac OS10 webpage.
And the thing that you want to download is
this r-2.15.1.
package
file.
So when you click on that.
It'll start to download and I'll spare you
the details
there but basically it'll download this
file to your computer.
So that's this file right here so I'll
double click on it and I'll start the
installer.
You'll see it's kind of the usual Mac OS X
installer.
Hit Continue, you'll see that there, I'll
see you kind of what's included in there.
So to continue you've
got to agree to the licenses.
General public license version two, I'll
agree to that.
If you hit install,
type in your password to allow
installation as it goes you'll
see it is kind of installing all the files
to your system.
And we're just going to skip over all
this.
You're just going to have to trust me that
it's not very interesting.
And so the installation was successful.
You can see that was pretty
straightforward.
If I hit Close then that means we're done.
So if I want to find R now I can just
open up the finder here and go to my
Applications folder,
and I've got R here at the top here
because
its got all the, I've got the folders
sorted by date.
So is I double click on the R icon.
You'll see that R loads up and we're
pretty much ready to go.
If I decide that I want to use R a little
bit
more often and I don't want to have to
open up the applications folder every
single time,
I can drift drag R to the dock over here,
and I'm going to put it right there.
And so now, when I want to use R, I can
just click on the R icon on the dock.
Starts bouncing up and down and R will
load it right away.
So that's it.
Selling R on the Mac couldn't be any
easier
